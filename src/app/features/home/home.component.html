    <h2>Hello, I'm Benomar El Mdeghri</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Computer Engineering student at EMI Rabat, passionate about competitive programming and mathematics. My journey began in Fes, Morocco, and has taken me from local competitions to representing Morocco on the international stage.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As the <strong>MOI 2021 champion</strong> and a <strong>Master on Codeforces</strong>, I've accumulated <strong>10 national titles</strong> across various programming contests. Beyond competing, I serve as <strong>Head of the MOI Scientific Committee</strong> and <strong>President of IT AcadEMI</strong>, mentoring the next generation of programmers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Recently, I've expanded into mathematics competitions, earning a <strong>silver medal at IMC 2025</strong> in Sofia, Bulgaria. This timeline captures my evolution from a curious student to an international competitor, driven by excellence and continuous learning.
